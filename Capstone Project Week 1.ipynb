For years, you could only get coffee beans and grounds from a few companies and regions, but the foodservice trend toward higher-quality and craft foods has opened up many other options. Nowadays, there is a nearly endless selection of coffee from all over the world that wouldn't have been available a few decades ago.\n\nThe age of coffee consumers also has decreased. The change was identified through the findings of a 2017 study on coffee consumption. The study was published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine and involved more than 520,000 people. Their findings showed that drinking coffee regularly could improve life expectancy. After these results were published, the National Coffee Association (NCA) discovered that the percentage of daily coffee drinkers increased from 57% to 62% in the course of a year. In the United States alone, 44% of those coffee consumers are millennials. (https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/2356/top-coffee-trends.html)\n\nThere are 941 coffee shops in the metropolitan area of Santiago and this number has been increasing in the last 10 years. (http://santiagocoffeelovers.cl/cafeterias-especialidad-nuevo-mundo-sabores-experiencias/)\n\nWe will explore the metropolitan area of Santiago to find the best locations based on a good quality of life with less number of coffee shops and places frequented by young people.",
